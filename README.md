## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ReactJs
- Styled Component
- React router(Client side rendering)

### What I learned

- I learned a lot building this project. I used react router which makes my work more faster and I also tried as much as possible to make this website responsive and accessible using various attributes and leveraging on reactJS logics and styles for the functionalities. The local data.json file provided is not working properly. The images are broken so I had to use the contents only together with the local pictures provided. I also added 404 page as a plus

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on is basically how to consume APIs for bigger projects, responsiveness, accessibility and best practices.

## Acknowledgments

I want to use this medium to thank my brilliant teacher/tutor @kelvin Powell and John Smilga. Making the site responsive and accessible was a big thing for me at the start so I decided to take Kelvin's course which enlighten me more on how to build this project and i really learn a lot from his course as well. Am currently taking John Smilga react course on Udemy. I have learn greatly from building an e-commerce website together with him which also motivated me to take on this frontend mentor challenge
